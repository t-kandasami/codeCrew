3. Navigate to API Keys section
4. Create a new API key
5. Copy the API key (starts with `sk-`)

### 2. Configure Environment Variables
Add the following to your backend `.env` file:

```env
# OpenAI Configuration
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
The OpenAI dependency has been added to `requirements.txt`. Rebuild your backend:

```bash
# If using Docker
docker-compose build backend

# If running locally
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Restart Backend
Restart your backend service to load the new environment variables.
